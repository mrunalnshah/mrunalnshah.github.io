          <p class="ip-desc">
            Copyright refers to the legal right of the owner of intellectual
            property. In simpler terms, copyright is the right to copy. This
            means that the original creators of products and anyone they give
            authorization to are the only ones with the exclusive right to
            reproduce the work. Copyright law gives creators of original
            material the exclusive right to further use and duplicate that
            material for a given amount of time. Once a copyright expires, the
            copyrighted item becomes public domain.

          <p class="ip-desc">
            One safeguard that can be used to legally protect an original
            creation is copyright. Under copyright law, a work is considered
            original if the author created it from independent thinking void of
            duplication. This type of work is known as an Original Work of
            Authorship (OWA).Not all types of work can be copyrighted. A
            copyright does not protect ideas, discoveries, concepts, or
            theories. Brand names, logos, slogans, domain names, and titles also
            cannot be protected under copyright law. For an original work to be
            copyrighted, it has to be in tangible form.This means that any
            speech, discoveries, musical scores, or ideas have to be written
            down in physical form in order to be protected by copyright.
