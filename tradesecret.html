            A trade secret is any practice or process of a company that is
            generally not known outside of the company. Information considered a
            trade secret gives the company a competitive advantage over its
            competitors and is often a product of internal research and
            development. Trade secrets are secret practices and processes that
            give a company a competitive advantage over its competitors. Trade
            secrets may differ across jurisdictions but have three common
            traits: not being public, offering some economic benefit, and being
            actively protected.

            Trade secrets may take a variety of forms, such as a proprietary
            process, instrument, pattern, design, formula, recipe, method, or
            practice that is not evident to others and may be used as a means to
            create an enterprise that offers an advantage over competitors or
            provides value to customers. As confidential information (as trade
            secrets are known in some jurisdictions), trade secrets are the
            "classified documents" of the business world, just as top-secret
            documents are closely guarded by government agencies. There are many
            examples of trade secrets that are tangible and intangible. For
            example, Google's search algorithm exists as intellectual property
            in code and is regularly uThe secret formula for Coca-Cola, which is
            locked in a vault, is an example of a trade secret that is a formula
            or recipe. Since it has not been patented, it has never been
            revealed.
