                <h1 class="ip-title">Trademark</h1>
                <p class="ip-desc">The term trademark refers to a recognizable insignia, phrase, word, or symbol that denotes a specific product and legally differentiates it from all other products of its kind. 
                    A trademark exclusively identifies a product as belonging to a specific company and recognizes the company's ownership of the brand. 
                    Trademarks are generally considered a form of intellectual property and may or may not be registered.
                </p>
                &nbsp;
                <p class="ip-desc">Trademarks not only help distinguish products within the legal and business systems but just as significantly with consumers. 
                    They are used to identify and protect words and design elements that identify the source, owner, or developer of a product or service. 
                    They can be corporate logos, slogans, bands, or the brand name of a product.
                 </p>
                 &nbsp;
                 <p class="ip-desc">Using a trademark prevents others from using a company or individual's products or services without their permission. 
                    They also prohibit any marks that have a likelihood of confusion with an existing one. 
                    This means that a business cannot use a symbol or brand name if it looks or sounds similar, or has a similar meaning to one thatâ€™s already on the books especially if the products or services are related. 
                    For instance, a soft drink company can't legally use a symbol that looks like that of Coca-Cola and it can't use a name that sounds like Coke.
