        But you have come here, so here is some knowledge.

        Soul > Streams of consciousness > Idea > deeds.

        Example : deeds can only be won only by idea ; ideas can only be won only by instincts or Stream of consciousness ; 
                  and stream of consciousness can only be won by soul.

                  to win stream of consciousness ( attachements, anger ) you need to win your soul.
    
        I got this funny sort of static in my head these days, too. Hard to focus sometimes...
