          <p class="ip-desc">
            Patents are one of the oldest forms of intellectual property
            protection. The basic aim of a patent system is to encourage
            economic and technological development by rewarding individual
            creativity and/or intellectual. A patent under the act is a grant
            from the government to inventors, for a limited period of time, the
            exclusive right to make, use, exercise, and vend the invention.
          </p>
          &nbsp;
          <p class="ip-desc">
            As per Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), Article
            33, the periods of patent is 20 years from the date of filing of the
            application for a patent. At the end of patent period, the
            government publishes the invention and it becomes part of the public
            domain. In other words, after the expiry of patent period the public
            can make use of the patent. As part of the public domain it is
            assumed that the disclosure of patent for public will stimulate
            ideas and perhaps even the development of an even better product
            that could replace the original.
          </p>
          &nbsp;
          <p class="ip-desc">
            Patents as one’s exclusive property rights can be sold, transferred,
            willed, licensed, or used as collateral much like other valuable
            assets. In fact, most independent inventors do not commercialise
            their inventions or create new products from their ideas, instead,
            they sell or license their patents to others who have the resources
            to develop. To quote one such case, the Coca-Cola formula was
            developed by a compounder. He could not commercialise it due to lack
            of required resources. He sold it to a doctor who commercialised
            ‘the Coca Cola formula’.
